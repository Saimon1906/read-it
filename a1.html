That's the problem with our society. It doesn't has to be any spacifique nation. almost every nation suffers from it. on paper the situation may seem normal. but in reality it is no where near close to normal.</p> <p>in Bangladesh poor young adults are graduating from engineering universities and finding no job flipping tea at a stall or starts doing jobs as overqualified personal. which is a insult to humanity. they don't want to but it's not like they have any choice. in usa things looks so nice on paper but new graduates are getting replaced by automation faster then wars starts now a days. in china teens are getting replaced faster then ai bubble is brusting now. and because of this new gens all around the world who are a little bit less meritorious are forced to do blue collar jobs though they became over qualified. </p> </div> </body> </html>
